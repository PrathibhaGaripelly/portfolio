  <h3>About</h3>
  I am a theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of history's greatest and most influential physicists. I not only developed the theory of relativity, but I also made significant contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics.

  <h3>Blogs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (1905): This article, commonly known as Einstein's special theory of relativity, introduced the concept of space-time and transformed our understanding of the nature of space and time. Read the article here: http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/specrel.pdf</li>
    <li>"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?" (1905): This article, commonly known as Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, introduced the equation E=mcÂ², which shows that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. Read the article here: https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/107</li>
    <li>"On the Quantum Theory of Radiation" (1917): This article introduced the concept of stimulated emission, which is the basis for the development of the laser. Read the article here: https://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/History/Files/einstein1917b.pdf</li>
    <li>"Geometry and Experience" (1921): This article discussed the nature of geometry and its relationship to physical reality, and argued that the geometry of physical space is not necessarily Euclidean.</li>
    <li>"Autobiographical Notes" (1949): This article, written near the end of Einstein's life, provided a glimpse into his personal life, his childhood, his education, and his scientific work.</li>
